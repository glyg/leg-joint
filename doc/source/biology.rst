The drosophila leg joint morphogenesis
======================================

Overview
========

At the pupal stages of development, drosophila *imaginal disks*
transform into the future parts of the fly body. The **leg disks**
grow to form the future legs of the adult fly.

The leg disk consists in a one cell thick epithelial sheet of
ellipsolidal shape. On specific bands of the epithelium, folds are
formed, corresponding to the future leg joints.

The morphogenesis of those folds depends on the apoptosis (progammed
cell death) of some cells of the epithelium.

The apical junctions
====================

Close to the outer cell surface of the epithelium, a lattice of
interacting acto-myosin cytosqueleton and adherans proteins form the
**apical junctions** at the edge of each cells. Those junctions can
exert forces that will modify the local form of the epithelium.


Apoptosis as the driving source of leg joint morphogensis
=========================================================

As cells undergo apoptosis around specific bands on the epithelium,
the fold gets more and more pronounced. This fold formation si myosin dependant.
